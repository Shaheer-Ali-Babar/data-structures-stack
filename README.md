What is a Stack?
A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Imagine a stack of plates: you add (push) new plates on top, and you remove (pop) the top plate first. This simple yet powerful concept is crucial in various computing applications.

Key Operations
1. Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
2. Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
3. Peek/Top: View the top element without removing it.
4. IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.

Why Use Stacks?
Stacks are used in numerous scenarios such as:
Function Call Management: Handling function calls and recursion in programming languages.
Expression Evaluation: Parsing and evaluating expressions in calculators and compilers.
Undo Mechanism: Implementing undo functionalities in text editors and software applications.
